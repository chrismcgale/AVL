# rangeTree
rangeTree OOP implementation using AVL

What is an AVL? A self balancing BST with the difference between the heights of the children of a node being at most 1

What is a rangeTree? A 2d AVL where each AVL node of the first layer stores an AVL tree. The first layer is balanced by x values, the second by y values.

Why? very fast 2d rangeSearch. returns all the points between [x1,y1] x [x2,y2]
